# Laser-cut Zynthian-branded knobs

These Zynthian-branded knobs can be laser-cut and assembled as accessories to compliment a laser-cut Zynthian case. They are made from six discs of **3 mm material** stacked and glued together.

## Laser cut files

Laser-cut files are provided in .dxf and .svg formats. The files are colour-coded and should be cut in the following order:

1. Blue - engrave
2. Red - inside cut
3. Black - outside cut

The knobs in the photo were made using [LaserWeb4](https://github.com/LaserWeb/LaserWeb4) and a K-40 laser cutter.

## Assembly

It is suggested that the discs be glued together on an encoder shaft to ensure proper aligment of the shaft hole.


## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
