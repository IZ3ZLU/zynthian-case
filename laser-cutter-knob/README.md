# Laser-cut Zynthian-branded knobs

These Zynthian-branded knobs can be laser-cut and assembled as accessories to compliment a laser-cut Zynthian case. They are made from six discs of **3 mm material** stacked and glued together.

## Laser cut files

Laser-cut files are provided in .dxf and .svg formats. The files are colour-coded and should be cut in the following order:

1. Blue - engrave
2. Red - inside cut
3. Black - outside cut

The knobs in the photo were made using [LaserWeb4](https://github.com/LaserWeb/LaserWeb4) and a K-40 laser cutter.

## Assembly

It is suggested that the discs be glued together on an encoder shaft to ensure proper aligment of the shaft hole.
